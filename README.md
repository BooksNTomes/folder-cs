# Folder Cleaner and Sorter (folder-cs)
- A simple python program for sorting a folder's contents into directories based on file types.
- A hobby project, initially based on a tutorial, that may grow in features.

# Feature
- Sorts a folders files based on type (Typically the downloads folder), configurable through the FOLDER_PATH at sources.py

# Features I may add
- Automated Directory Creation: Rough idea is for user to provide a folder structure tree, and the program generates it
- and others
